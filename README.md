This is for testing my knowledge in git.
First i created master branch,then i created one sub branch name Sub-branch1 from git itself.

After that i clone the master branch in my pc and create another branch name as Sub-branch2,then push it in my git cloud. 

After that i again clone the Sub-branch1 in my pc and change something in README file,then push it in my git cloud again.
